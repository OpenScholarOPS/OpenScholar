## Project Overview

OpenScholar is a revolutionary open-access digital research platform designed to transform how researchers collaborate, share, and discuss their work. By eliminating traditional publishing barriers, the platform democratizes research and incentivizes high-quality contributions through a token-based system ($OPS tokens).

The platform supports the entire research lifecycle - from idea conception and collaboration to peer review, publication, and community discussion. OpenScholar creates a transparent, efficient ecosystem where quality research is rewarded, and knowledge is accessible to all.

### Core Features

- **Research Fields Organization**: Content is organized into eight major fields (Computer Science, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Medicine, Economics, and Psychology), each with specialized features.
- **Discussion System**: Researchers can create and participate in academic discussions, organized by field and topic.
- **User System**: Authentication via Supabase, user profiles with academic credentials, and a reputation system based on contributions.
- **Wallet Integration**: Phantom wallet integration for managing $OPS tokens on the Solana blockchain.
- **Paper Management**: Share and discuss research papers with DOI integration and version control.
- **Peer Review System**: Transparent and incentivized peer review process with token rewards.
- **Governance System**: Community-driven platform governance through proposal and voting mechanisms.
- **Data Visualization**: Advanced research metrics and data visualization tools.

## Logo Symbolism

The OpenScholar logo represents the fusion of academic knowledge and decentralized technology:

- **Flask**: Symbolizes scientific research and experimentation
- **Network**: Represents the decentralized nature of the platform and knowledge connections
- **Chat Bubble**: Illustrates the collaborative discussion aspects of academic research
- **Blue Gradient**: Signifies trust, knowledge, and the fluid nature of innovation

The logo is available in three variants:
- Full logo (`logo.svg`): Complete brand identity with all elements
- Simple logo (`logo-simple.svg`): Streamlined version for medium-sized applications
- Favicon (`favicon.svg`): Minimalist version for browser tabs and small UI elements

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication, database management, real-time updates, and row-level security
- **Blockchain**: Solana blockchain for $OPS tokens, with Phantom wallet integration
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js, react-chartjs-2
- **Date Handling**: date-fns, react-datepicker
